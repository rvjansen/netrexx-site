<H1> Basic concepts </H1>
<P>
<EM>In this chapter I'll try to give an overview of all
the basic concepts which, in my opinion, are required to
fully understand the following chapters.</EM>

</P>
<P>
<EM>If you're familiar with the concepts exposed here, you
can just jump immediately to the next chapter.</EM>

<H2> <IMG SRC="yellowball.gif"> The Java language </H2>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX2"></A>
Java is an object-oriented programming language developed
by Sun Microsystems (TM). A Java program might look like a C or C++ program,
due to Java's similarities to those languages.
Indeed, Java is not based on C, neither on C++. There has been
no effort to make Java compatible with those two languages.

</P>
<P>
One important point to keep in mind is that
<STRONG>Java was designed with the idea to allow execution of code
across a network.</STRONG>

</P>
<P>
The main feature of Java is that the COMPILED code is
platform independent. To achieve this, Java compiles to an intermediate
form; Java byte-code. This code is then interpreted "on-the-fly" by a
platform-dependent, Java interpreter.

</P>

<PRE>
 
  +------------+
  |            |
  | SOURCE     |
  |            |
  +------------+
      hello.java
       =
       =     (compilation)
       =     <STRONG>javac hello.java</STRONG>
       V
  +------------+
  |            |
  |JAVA BYTE   |
  |CODE        |
  +------------+
     hello.class
 
</PRE>

<P>
The Java Compiler creates a Java class file, which does not
contain any instruction which is architecture dependent. You will
not find Pentium, rs6000, MAC, etc. instructions in a class file:
you will find code which is understood by a Java Virtual
Machine: an interpreter which knows how to translate
the Java byte-code into your machine's instructions.

</P>

<PRE>
 
  +-----------------------+
  | JAVA BYTE CODE        | &#60;- architecture independent
  | (class)               |
  +-----------------------+
  |                       |
  | JAVA VIRTUAL MACHINE  | &#60;- architecture dependent
  |                       |
  +-----------------------+
  |///////////////////////|
  | MACHINE (PC,MAC,WS)   | &#60;- your machine
  |///////////////////////|
  +-----------------------+
 
</PRE>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX3"></A>
<A NAME="IDX4"></A>
<A NAME="IDX5"></A>
So, the <STRONG>Java Virtual Machine</STRONG> is just a special
interpreter, that "understands" a class file.

</P>
<P>
The idea is not new: it was available in UCSD Pascal, and the
intermediate code was the so-called <STRONG>p-code</STRONG>.

</P>
<P>
When running code across a network, you must eliminate some of the
language features which might allow any malicious code
to gain access to your computer.
Notably, Java's designers had to take away
the concept of a "pointer", largely used in C and C++.
Java programs cannot access arbitrary addresses in
your machine memory.

</P>


<H2> <IMG SRC="yellowball.gif"> Java and the WEB </H2>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX6"></A>
The capability to interpret Java byte-code is available
on most WWW browsers available today.

</P>
<P>
If an HTML document contains a &#60;class&#62; statement, the
browser will fetch the class, (if you don't already have it on
your machine) and execute the code. The
important thing to stress is that the code, at this
point, runs on YOUR machine, not on the server
from where you downloaded the HTML document.

</P>

<PRE>
 

  WWW Browser                       http Daemon
  -----------                       -----------
  (client)                          (server)

    (URL)
              --(URL request)----&#62;
              &#60;--(HTML doc)------

   ...
   &#60;class &#62;
              --(class request)--&#62;
              &#60;--(class)----------

   CLASS runs
   HERE

 
</PRE>

<P>
Java adds <STRONG>local</STRONG> interaction to the WEB,
and offloads processing from the server to the client.

</P>
<P>
What's the gain in such an approach? Why not run
the code directly in the server side?
(like you do whenever you issue a <STRONG>cgi-bin</STRONG>
command)?

</P>
<P>
If your application manipulates data and displays
it graphically, the Java approach is definitely more
efficient, both in terms of reduced network traffic
and perceived execution speed.

</P>
<P>
For example: suppose that your company wants to display
several histograms on their WWW home page. You could have the pictures
(in <STRONG>gif</STRONG> or <STRONG>jpg</STRONG> format) stored in
the HTML daemon directory. Each time the document is requested,
potentially hunders of kilobytes of data is transfered across the network.
Using Java, you download
the application that implements a
histogram viewer, and the data
to build the histogram to your machine; usually significantly less
data than the pre-built images.

</P>


<H2> <IMG SRC="yellowball.gif"> JDK </H2>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX7"></A>
<A NAME="IDX8"></A>
JDK is an acronym for Java Developer Kit. It is a set
of programs that allows you to compile your java code and to
execute it (using the Java Interpreter).

</P>
<P>
The JDK is distributed freely by Sun, and you can download
it from Sun's site:

<PRE>
 
<A href="http://java.sun.com">http://java.sun.com</A>
 
</PRE>

<P>
See the Appendix I for more details.

</P>
<P>
The JDK is made up by the following tools:

<UL>
<LI>a compiler <EM>javac</EM>

<LI>a debugger

<LI>an interpreter, or, if you prefer, a

      Java Virtual Machine (Java VM) <EM>java</EM>
<LI>an applet viewer <EM>appletviewer</EM>

<LI>other miscellaneous tools

</UL>

<P>
The JDK also includes all the Java class files that you need
to compile and run your java programs.

</P>
<P>
The JDK is NOT a visual development environment, like
Microsoft's J++ or Symatec's Cafe'.
<A NAME="IDX9"></A>
<A NAME="IDX10"></A>
<A NAME="IDX11"></A>
Sun's JDK has been defined as "primitive" [GREHAN, 1997] by
some authors, since all the package's tools run from
the command line. Other people [HAROLD, 1997] definitely
prefer JDK's "minimalist" approach vs. more fancy products,
sometimes still in beta test.

</P>
<P>
If you are an "old fashion" programmer like me, you'll probably
prefer JDK's approach, which resembles the development
process I followed on VM/370 and VS/COBOL; edit,
compile, and run all from the command line.

</P>
<P>
For NetRexx there is no IDE at the moment, so you are forced
to use JDK's approach anyway.

</P>


<H2> <IMG SRC="yellowball.gif"> Java Classes </H2>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX12"></A>
Like other languages; notably FORTRAN, Java is a relatively simple
language.  The power of these languages is derived, not from the
language itself, but from the extensibility of the language.
Without high level mathematical packages and functions in FORTRAN,
you would not be able to do much of any significance.  Java, without its
Class Libraries is the same.

</P>


<H2> <IMG SRC="yellowball.gif"> Applications </H2>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX13"></A>
<A NAME="IDX14"></A>
An <STRONG>application</STRONG> is, generally speaking, a stand-alone program
which you launch from the command line. An application
has unrestricted access to the host system.
An application can read/write files on your system
using your access privileges, it can open socket connections
with any address, etc.

</P>
<P>
Technically, a NetRexx application is a NetRexx program that
has a main() method, or no method at all (NetRexx will
add the main() for you).

</P>


<H2> <IMG SRC="yellowball.gif"> Applets </H2>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX15"></A>

</P>
<P>
An <STRONG>applet</STRONG> is a program which is run in the context
of an <STRONG>applet viewer</STRONG> or of a <STRONG>WEB browser</STRONG>.
An <STRONG>applet</STRONG> has very limited access to the system
where it runs; for example, an applet cannot read
files, neither can it establish socket connections to
systems other than the one from where the applet was downloaded.

</P>
<P>
Technically speaking, an applet is a NetRexx class
which extends the Java class <STRONG>java.applet.Applet</STRONG>.

</P>


<H2> <IMG SRC="yellowball.gif"> Javascript </H2>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX16"></A>
You might have found, in several WEB pages, portions of code
that are executed by the browser. This code is written
using <STRONG>javascript</STRONG>. To make it clear, <STRONG>javascript</STRONG>
has nothing to do with <STRONG>java</STRONG>.
The black beverage that you find in fast-foods has nothing
to do with the nectar you drink at "La Tazza d'oro" (Via degli
Orfani 82, in Rome). People ( not the same people, indeed)
call both of them coffees,  but that's the only thing
they share. So Java and Javascript
just share (a portion of) the name.
"The intersection of Java and Javascript is the empty
set." [VAN DER LINDEN, 1997].

</P>
<P>
Javascript was invented by Netscape Inc., and it is a simple
scripting language, imbedded in HTML files. It offers
loops and conditional tests.

</P>
<P>
As an example of Javascript, look at the following code:

JavaBeans is a public specification developed by Sun,
in consultation with other vendors and with the Java community.
JavaBeans is a component model, which lets you build
and use Java-based components.

</P>
<P>
The <STRONG>beans</STRONG> is just a Java class with some additional
descriptive information. Why this additional information?
Because this information is used to make beans reusable software components,
which can be manipulated by building tools.
This allows non-programmers, using an <STRONG>authoring tool</STRONG>, to
assemble an application using the provided components.
