<H1> Review of this book </H1>
<P>
 

<UL>
<LI><STRONG>What is NetRexx?</STRONG>

<EM>
Quoting NetRexx's author, Mike Cowlishaw, "NetRexx is a programming
language derived from both REXX and Java(tm); NetRexx is a dialect
of REXX, so it is as easy to learn and use as REXX, and it retains
the portability and efficiency of Java."
Using NetRexx you can create programs and applets for the
Java environment more easily than programming in Java itself.
Using NetRexx you rarely have to worry about the different
types and numbers that Java requires. The "dirty" job is
done by the language for you.</EM>

<LI><STRONG>What is REXX?</STRONG>

<EM>
  REXX is an interpreted language originally developed 
by IBM in 1979. REXX was designed to be
platform-independent and is the procedural language shipped with
the operating system
both on Mainframe Systems (MVS, VM/CMS) and on Personal
Systems (OS/2, Amiga). REXX is available on almost
any platform as a product, or as a public domain
implementation.
</EM>
 
<EM>
  Due to its simplicity and ease of use, REXX can
be thought as a 'Personal' Language - practical not
only for the professional programmer, but also for
the occasional one. For example, you can use it to quickly test an algorithm
before implementation, even when using other languages.
</EM>
 
<LI><STRONG>To whom is this book addressed?</STRONG>

<EM>
  This book is addressed both to neophytes and to
experienced programmers starting to program
on ANY system where the Java JDK is installed.
</EM>
 
<EM>
  Almost  all the programming examples found in this
book are taken from 'real-life' situations. Among other useful skills, you will
learn how to write: a small routine for randomly accessing a
1.000.000 record file in a few milliseconds, a
real client server application using sockets, a 'pocket
calculator' with 200 significant
digits, and pull-down menus using curses.
</EM>
 
<LI><STRONG>What are the covered topics?</STRONG>

 

<UL>
<LI><EM>Introduction to the NetRexx language</EM>

<LI><EM>Numbers,Strings and Control Structures</EM>

<LI><EM>Class and Methods</EM>

<LI><EM>Operations on files, sockets and threads</EM>

<LI><EM>Applets</EM>

<LI><EM>Graphical User Interfaces</EM>

</UL>

 
<LI><STRONG>Is this a User Guide, a Tutorial or a Reference Manual?</STRONG>

 
<EM>
The answer is "something of all these".
In fact, the best definition is probably an "Advanced User Guide
with Reference Sections". Previous programming experience
is needed in order to fully understand this book, and thus it is 
NOT a user guide in the true sense of the term.
However, I felt it necessary to include reference
information for those users who might not have the NetRexx reference book
readily available to them. Some chapters also needed amplification,
since they describe functions not documented elsewhere.
</EM>
 
<LI><STRONG>Where can I find the examples?</STRONG>

 
<EM>
All the examples used in this book are available on Internet
via WWW at the URL:</EM>
