<H1> Preface </H1>



<H2> <IMG SRC="yellowball.gif"> Introduction. </H2>

<P>
This book is addressed to both professional programmers and
end users who want to learn more about the <STRONG>NetRexx</STRONG> language.

</P>
<P>
<STRONG>NOTE:</STRONG> The following documentation refers to NetRexx
version 1.00 and following.

<H2> <IMG SRC="yellowball.gif"> When to use NetRexx. </H2>
<P>
This topic is likely to be a source of endless arguments (both pro and
con).

</P>
<P>
This is my genuine opinion.

</P>
<P>
<STRONG>PROs:</STRONG>

<UL>
<LI>NetRexx is very easy to read.

  You can practically program in English <A NAME="DOCF1" HREF="nr_foot.html#FOOT1">(1)</A>

<LI>there is only ONE NetRexx native data type (the string);

<LI>there is almost no need for special characters

     (like delimiters, identifiers, etc);

<LI>NetRexx has very powerful features, such as

  arbitrary numeric precision, parsing, easy string
  handling, etc.

<LI>NetRexx is not tailored to a particular operating system;

  the very same code can run on:


<UL>
<LI><STRONG>Windows 95/NT</STRONG> (TM),

<LI><STRONG>UNIX (TM) (eg. AIX (TM), HP/UX (TM), IRIX (TM), SunOS (TM), Solaris (TM), etc.)</STRONG>,

<LI><STRONG>OS/2</STRONG> (TM),

<LI><STRONG>Macintosh</STRONG> (TM),

</UL>

In fact NetRexx will run on any platform that supplies a Java Virtual
Machine (JVM) (TM) (more on this later.

<LI>If you are (or were) a FORTRAN, PL/I

  or PASCAL programmer you will probably
  find NetRexx closer to your 'way-of-programming'
  than any other language available for the JVM.  NetRexx eases the
  transition for programmers familiar with "procedural" languages
  into the object oriented paradigm.
</UL>

<P>
<STRONG>CONs:</STRONG>

<UL>
<LI>NetRexx is <STRONG>not</STRONG> ( or at least not <STRONG>exactly</STRONG>)

  Rexx, so Rexx (or Object Rexx) fans will be faced with a
  "transition period". You cannot get your Rexx
  code immediately running in NetRexx (as you can
  do with Object Rexx) unless it is a very simple program.
<LI>NetRexx compiles your program into Java byte-code.

  The code is then very much slower, in terms of execution,
  than a native Object Rexx or "classic" Rexx.
  I've measured up to a order of magnitude slower.
  This performance problem is due to the Java byte-code running in the
  JVM and is not an inherant problem with NetRexx; raw Java code is
  just as slow!
</UL>



<H2> <IMG SRC="yellowball.gif"> About the examples in this book. </H2>
<P>
&#62;From the very first chapters,
I will present and discuss
some 'real' NetRexx program atoms (i.e. code fragments
(usually methods) ) that you can use
in your programs after having learnt
the language.

</P>
<P>
I have noticed that many
'user guides' present as examples, programs you will
probably never use again in your life; in fact these programs are
often totally
useless, brought into existence only so that the author can
show particular features of the language involved.

</P>
<P>
I prefer to give you something 'real';
program atoms you can insert in
your code, or programs you can run and
use even after having finished with this book.
The obvious disadvantage in such an approach is that some
constructs may not be entirely clear, since they will only be explained
several chapters further on. Please be patient, and do not be concerned
about things that, at a particular point in
your progress through the book, are not completely
understood. You can always come back to them later.

<H2> <IMG SRC="yellowball.gif"> Conventions. </H2>
<P>
In order to be consistent, a 'standard' is being followed
in presenting the various code samples and running examples.

</P>
<P>
When I show a full program example, the code appears like this:

<P>
Line numbers may be used in comments related to the code.
You will find the file id at the
bottom right-hand corner of the code, making it
easier to find the referenced portion of the code if you already have
the sample code on your computer.

</P>
<P>
When referring to only a small piece of a program, the code appears
like this:

</P>

<PRE>
 
------------------------------------------------------
if test then
  do
    say 'Running in test mode.'
  end

                                            if example

Example sessions are presented like this:

<P>
What you should type is written in <STRONG>bold</STRONG> characters.
The <EM>rsl3pm1 (NNN)</EM> prompts are simply those of the machine
from which sample sessions were taken, so just ignore them.

</P>
<P>
Syntax examples appear as:

<PRE>

with the method invocation in <STRONG>bold</STRONG> characters, and the

Several reviewers have helped, by questions and comments,
to clarify the aims and exposition of the book.
<STRONG>Mark Hessling</STRONG> was extremely helpful in reading the
preliminary version of the book, which was typeset using his
XEDIT-like text editor; THE.

</P>
<P>
Many thanks also to <STRONG>Bernard Antoine</STRONG> and
<STRONG>David Asbury</STRONG> of the CERN CN division  for their
