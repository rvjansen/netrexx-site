  <h2>Welcome to the NetRexx Programming Language!</h2>
  <p><strong>NetRexx</strong> is a general-purpose programming
  language inspired by two very different programming languages, Rexx
  and Java. It is designed for people, not computers. In this respect
  it follows Rexx closely, with many of the concepts and most of the
  syntax taken directly from Rexx or its object-oriented version,
  Object Rexx. From Java it derives static typing, binary arithmetic,
  the object model, and exception handling. "A smart language designed
  for real people, and vice versa." Originally a product from the IBM
  Hursley Software Lab, NetRexx has always been free software and is
  free and open
  source since June 11th, 2011. It is the first alternative language
  for the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).
  <h3>Why NetRexx?</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>NetRexx makes programming easy, and fun again</li>
    <li>The Rexx type, combining numeric and string processing in one
    class</li>
    <li>Unlimited precision arithmetic built into the language</li>
    <li>Interpret your code or compile to JVM .class files</li>
    <li>Lightning fast performance compared to other JVM scripting languages</li>
    <li>Seamless integration to all JVM libraries</li>
    <li>Built-in luxurious parsing and tracing</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h3>Hursley Labs</h3>
  <blockquote>
  Hursley, located near Winchester in the UK, is the place
  where many famous products originate.  Incidentally, in Hursley <b>
  <jsp:useBean id="clocktime" class="com.rvjansen.qtime" />
  <jsp:getProperty name="clocktime" property="out" /></b>, according to
  the <a href="netrexx/netrexxc/examples/ibm-historic/qtime.nrx">qtime</a> program, one of the first-ever Rexx programs, dating from
  1979. This is the NetRexx version from 1996, which is almost
  identical. Being British, NetRexx listens to both <i>center</i>
  and <i>centre</i> method spellings.

  <h3>MFC on NetRexx</h3>
  <blockquote>
  <p>The seamless integration of types into what was previously an essentially typeless language does seem to have been a success, offering the advantages of strong typing while preserving the ease of use and speed of development that Rexx programmers have enjoyed.
  The end result of adding Java typing capabilities to the Rexx language is a single language that has both the Rexx strengths for scripting and for writing macros for applications and the Java strengths of robustness, good efficiency, portability, and security for application development.</p>
  <p>-- Mike Cowlishaw</p>
