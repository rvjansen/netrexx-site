<p>An open source language needs a community of dedicated language users and
  language developers in order to thrive. NetRexx has both of these and the
  language has staunch followers since its inception. Since open
  sourcing the language, development has
  been taken over by a group of volunteers that insures that the
  language stays up to date with current JVM developments. Mike
  Cowlishaw performs the role of language architect in the NetRexx
  Language Architecture Board (ARB) where designs for changes and
  additions to the language are discussed.

	The source code repository is located at the SourceForge open source
    project repository. Here the sourcecode of the language translator
    and several tools can be browsed online. or downloaded using a
    <a href="http://git-scm.com">git</a>
    client. Eclipse-git will work, as do several GUI-type
	clients like Tortoise-git.
	Be sure to register a userid with the SourceForce project site
    if you want to compile your own version of the translator, want to
    help out or just want to see how it works. NetRexx is written in NetRexx!
